Welcome to Breakthrough!
This is a board game I invented, based on the rules of Conway's Soldiers.
Run file GameRunner to play the game

To play the game, just download the .jar file.

The game is designed to be even harder than Chess; Your turn easily can consist of up to 20 moves, with millions, if not trillions, of possible outcomes.
Good luck trying to find a winning strategy!

I am looking to make this an online game at some point, as well as making a computer engine to play against.
